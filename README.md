# CKEditor Plugin #

## Description ##
This plugin provides CKEditor for editing messages and templates within phplist. It also integrates the KCFinder file manager to provide file upload and selection.

The plugin has been included in phplist since release 3.2.0 of phplist, so you should not normally need to install the plugin yourself.

## Compatibility ###

CKEditor and KCFinder are compatible with all the major browsers, see the CKEditor site <http://ckeditor.com/about>
and the KCFinder site <http://kcfinder.sunhater.com/>

## Installation ##

### Set the plugin directory ###
The default plugin directory is `plugins` within the admin directory.

You can use a directory outside of the web root by changing the definition of `PLUGIN_ROOTDIR` in config.php.
The benefit of this is that plugins will not be affected when you upgrade phplist.

### Install through phplist ###
Install on the Manage Plugins page (menu Config > Manage Plugins) using the package URL `https://github.com/bramley/phplist-plugin-ckeditor/archive/master.zip`.

### Install manually ###
If installation through phplist does not work then you can install the plugin manually.

Download the plugin zip file from <https://github.com/bramley/phplist-plugin-ckeditor/archive/master.zip>

Expand the zip file, then copy the contents of the plugins directory to your phplist plugins directory.
This should contain

* the file CKEditorPlugin.php
* the directory CKEditorPlugin

### Enable the plugin ###
Click the Enable action button to enable the plugin. Note that only one editor can be enabled.

### Enabling KCFinder ###
The php GD extension is required to use KCFinder. If that extension is not installed then the CKEditor image control will still be available
but without the ability to upload and browse the image directory.

### Location of the KCFinder directory ###
The KCFinder directory must be within the web root.
If you have the default plugin location, `define("PLUGIN_ROOTDIR","plugins")` in config.php, then the plugin will use the correct path automatically.

If you have placed the plugin directory outside of the web root then you must move or copy the `kcfinder` directory from the plugin's
directory to somewhere within the web root.

Then use the Settings page (menu Config > Settings) to specify the path to the KCFinder directory.

The path should be from the web root, such as `/kcfinder`, not the filesystem path.

Also, if you move or rename the phplist directory or the plugin directory after installing the plugin, then you will need
to modify the path to KCFinder as it will not change automatically.

## Usage ##

For guidance on configuring the plugin see the plugin's page within the phplist documentation site <https://resources.phplist.com/plugin/ckeditor>.
